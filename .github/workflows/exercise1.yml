# Controls when the workflow will run
on: #workflow_dispatch
  # # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  # push:
  #   branches: [ "main" ]

  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
